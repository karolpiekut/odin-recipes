# odin-recipes

This is the first project from the Odin - a basic recipe website.

The goal is to create a HTML based structure with multiple pages, pictures, lists paragraphs. 

When completed, I will be able to demonstrate that I can create a basic HTML website with a clean file structure, HTML boilerplate, website content that is clear and easy to read.
